    State for the Orchestrator Agent with Router + ReAct pattern.

    Architecture:
        START → Router → [conditional edge based on intent]
                         ├── "simple" → Simple Response → Memory Hook → END
                         ├── "off_topic" → Simple Response → Memory Hook → END
                         └── "restaurant_search" → Orchestrator → Tools → ... → Memory Hook → END

    The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern interleaves reasoning and action:
    - Thought: Agent reasons about what to do next
    - Action: Agent calls a tool or provides final answer
    - Observation: System provides tool results
